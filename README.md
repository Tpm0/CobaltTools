# CobaltTools
A collection of experimental tools used to help aid my journey to become a better programmer
(some of the files are poorley written and have grammer mistakes)


1. dectohex(int: a)
   it will turn an int into a hex value then return it as a string
2. hextodec(int: a)
   Work in progress!
